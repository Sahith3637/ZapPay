# ZapPay - UPI Payment System

## Project Overview
ZapPay is a comprehensive UPI (Unified Payments Interface) payment system built on .NET Core 6+. The system enables secure and efficient digital payments through various UPI channels while maintaining high security standards and compliance with Indian banking regulations.

## Core Features

### 1. User Management
- Secure user registration with KYC verification (Aadhaar/PAN)
- OTP and password-based authentication
- JWT-based security implementation
- Profile management capabilities

### 2. UPI Payment Features
- Virtual Payment Address (VPA) management
- Multiple payment methods:
  - VPA-based transfers
  - Account number + IFSC transfers
  - Mobile number-based transfers
- UPI mandate support for recurring payments
- QR code generation and validation
- Integration with NPCI UPI APIs

### 3. Transaction Management
- Comprehensive transaction history
- Refund processing system
- Idempotent transaction handling
- Real-time transaction status updates

### 4. Notification System
- Multi-channel notifications (SMS/Email/Webhook)
- Real-time transaction alerts
- Security event notifications

## Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Backend Framework**: .NET Core 6+
- **Database**: PostgreSQL/SQL Server
- **API Architecture**: RESTful + gRPC
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ/Azure Service Bus
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Logging**: Serilog + ELK Stack
- **Testing**: XUnit/Moq, Postman

### Performance Requirements
